# Optimized Transmission System Design and Cost Analysis

##Overview
this project focuses on designing an optimized transmission system to integrate a new wind farm into the existing power grid while minimizing cost and ensuring reliable operation under peak loading and contingency scenarios.

##Project Description
1. Integrating the Cedar Creek Wind (CCW) farm into the Metropolis Light and Power (MLP) transmission network.
2. Add new transmission Line while minimizing cost and ensuring the system operates within its limit during both normal operation and N-1 contingency scenarios.
3.  Key Tasks
  - Load Flow Analysis
  - Contingency Analysis
  - Economic Analysis

##Design Process
1. performed load flow analysis without the CCW farm.
2. performed multiple contingency analysis with CCW identifying line and transformers violations.
3. Add new transmission lines and transformers to mitigate violations
